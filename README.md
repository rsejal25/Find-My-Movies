# Find-My-Movies'
I have Created a movie library web application with the below features using django-
	The application  have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )
	After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 
	They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. On the home page, different movie lists created by that user is also displayed.
	These lists are either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only the person who created can see this list )
	I have used OMDB API for the movie search option.
Steps to run the application-
At first new user has to register himself or herself
after registering and then signing up the user will be navigated to the home page
At home page user can search for movies ,create playlist and can also see the already created playlist and on clicking on the links user can see the movies list as well of the playlist
